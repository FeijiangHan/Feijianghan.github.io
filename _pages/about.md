<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm a Computer Science Master's student at the University of Pennsylvania<img src='./images/upenn.png' style="width: 1.35em;">, working on Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and NLP applications.

**[Note] I am actively applying for Ph.D. programs for Fall 2026 admission.**

At Penn, I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-callison-burch/), [Prof. Lyle Ungar](http://linkedin.com/in/lyle-ungar-b061474/), and [Delip Rao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deliprao/). I also collaborate with [Dr. Xiaodong Yu](https://www.xiaodongyu.me/) from AMD GenAI and [Prof. Yunhuai Liu](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1234/2111.htm) from Peking University.

My journey through diverse areas of computer science: backend engineering (Cpp, 2021) -> high-performance computing research (with Prof. Xu Liu from NCSU, 2022-2023) -> front end and human-computer interaction (with Prof. Ying Zhao from CSU, 2023-2024) -> IoT, reinforcement learning in crowdsensing systems (with Prof. Anfeng Liu from CSU, 2023-2024).
In my senior year (2024), I fell in love with NLP, and throughout my master's program (2025), I have been researching full-time on LLMs/VLMs. All NLP work listed below was completed in 2025.

In my senior year (2024), I fell in love with NLP and have since dedicated my master's program to research on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). All NLP work listed below was completed in 2024-2025.

My research centers on advancing LLMs and Multimodal LLMs through approaches that are ***E**ffective*, ***E**fficient*, and ***E**xplainable*. I currently focus on:

- **Unlocking LLMs' Internal Mechanisms**: Designing training-free & inference-time optimization methods grounded in attention patterns, activations, representations, token logits, and prompting mechanisms. I'm particularly interested in making models more interpretable while improving their performance (Where + What + How + Why)
- **Pushing Application Boundaries**: Building impactful systems in security, code understanding, and scientific automation, with measurable real-world outcomes. I believe in creating practical solutions that address open-end and unexplored real-world challenges.
- **Advancing Model Evolution**: Developing data synthesis and curation pipelines to overcome annotation & data collection bottlenecks, and exploring post-training optimization (SFT, RL) and distillation to make smaller models competitive (data, training, distillation, pruning)

I am also the co-founder of [Savable Koupon AI](https://www.koupon.ai/), where we build AI-driven price tracking, LLM-based product analysis, and recommendation systems for e-commerce.
