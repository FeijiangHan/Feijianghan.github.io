## Hi there üëã

I'm a Computer Science Master's student at the University of Pennsylvania, working on Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and NLP applications. **I'm graduating in Fall 2026 and currently applying for Ph.D. programs.**

I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-callison-burch/), [Prof. Lyle Ungar](http://linkedin.com/in/lyle-ungar-b061474/), and [Delip Rao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deliprao/) at the University of Pennsylvania. I also collaborate with [Xiaodong Yu](https://www.xiaodongyu.me/) from AMD and Jianheng Tang and [Prof. Yunhuai Liu](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1234/2111.htm) at Peking University.

I'm honored to receive the Xiaomi Special Scholarship (Top 10 university-wide), the National Scholarship for Outstanding Students (Top 5), and to have been selected as an Outstanding Graduate of the Class of 2024.

My research is dedicated to advancing Large Language Models and Multimodal LLMs through **E**ffective, **E**fficient, and **E**xplainable approaches. I'm particularly focused on:

- **Unlocking LLMs' Internal Mechanisms**: Developing training-free optimization methods by understanding and enhancing attention patterns, representations, logits, and prompting mechanisms
- **Pushing LLM Application Boundaries**: Developing innovative applications and benchmarking in security, code understanding, and scientific research automation
- **Advancing Model Evolution**: Building novel approaches for data synthesis and training optimization

Previously, I worked on reinforcement learning in crowdsensing systems and contributed to HCI research, which shaped my perspective on building practical AI solutions.
